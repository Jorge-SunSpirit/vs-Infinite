## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`.

After it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install most of the needed libraries.

hxCodec doesn't work with Haxe Module Manager, so it must be installed separately.
`haxelib git hxCodec https://github.com/polybiusproxy/hxCodec.git`

Afterwards, you're ready to compile!
